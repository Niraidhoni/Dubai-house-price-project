📌 Project Title: Dubai House Price Prediction & Analytics Dashboard
📘 Project Description

The Dubai House Price Prediction & Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze real estate market trends, identify pricing patterns, and support informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate investors.
This dashboard transforms raw housing data into a powerful visual system that provides insightful KPIs, charts, and trend analysis across different property categories and neighborhoods.

The project focuses on understanding how factors such as square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, property age, and neighborhood influence property prices in Dubai. It also segments properties into distinct categories—Budget, Mid-Range, and High-End—to provide clearer market segmentation insights.

🎯 Project Objectives

To analyze real estate pricing trends within Dubai’s housing market.

To predict and compare property prices across different neighborhoods.

To study the relationship between house features (SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms) and price.

To categorize listings into Budget, Mid-Range, and High-End segments.

To build an interactive dashboard for dynamic filtering and exploration.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Your dashboard highlights the following major KPIs:

Most Expensive Property – 492.20K

Average Price – 224.83K

Total Listings – 50K

Average Price per Sqft – $113.31

Oldest Property Age – 75 years

These KPIs give users a high-level overview of the market’s overall cost structure and inventory size.

📍 Dashboard Features
1. Filters Panel

Users can segment data by:

Bedrooms

Bathrooms

Neighborhood (Urban, Suburb, Rural)

Listing Category (Budget, Mid-Range, High-End)

These interactive slicers make the dashboard highly customizable.

2. Average Price by Neighborhood

A treemap chart shows how housing prices vary between:

Urban

Suburb

Rural

This helps identify which areas are more or less expensive.

3. Number of Listings by Neighborhood

A horizontal bar chart visualizes listing distribution across regions, showing where most properties are concentrated.

4. Distribution of Listing Category

A pie chart displays how total listings are divided among:

High-End

Budget

Mid-Range

This shows the market balance within the dataset.

5. Square Feet vs Price Analysis

A scatter plot analyzing the relationship between SquareFeet and Price for each property category.
This helps understand how size influences cost and how different price ranges compare.

6. Average Price by Year

A line chart showing year-wise housing price trends, helping identify:

Growth patterns

Market fluctuations

Annual highs and lows

📈 Insights Generated (Examples)

Urban areas tend to have the highest average property prices, while rural areas remain more affordable.

All three categories—Budget, Mid-Range, and High-End—have near-equal distribution, reflecting a balanced market dataset.

Square footage shows a positive correlation with price—larger properties cost significantly more.

Certain years show noticeable price spikes, indicating strong demand or market shifts.

Older properties (up to 75 years old) still exist in the dataset but may not drastically influence pricing.
